2.EFFECTIVENESS OF LICENSE GRANT

This License grants a limited, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, and 
distribute the project code only to non-Excluded Users. By using this project, the user is deemed
to have fully read, understood, and agreed to all terms of this License.

3.TERMINATION AND LEGAL LIABILITY

Should the licensor determine, through reasonable judgment, that any user belongs to the category
of Excluded Users or has violated any term of this License, the licensor reserves the right to 
immediately and unilaterally terminate all authorization for said user. In such a case, the user
must immediately destroy all acquired copies of the project and its derivative works and cease all
use. The licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action for any violation of this License.

4.LEGAL CONFLICT AND INVALIDITY

If any term of this License is found to be unenforceable due to a conflict with mandatory local laws
in its jurisdiction, that term shall be deemed invalid. However, such invalidity shall not affect the
validity of the other terms of this License. In this event, all other open-source or free software 
licenses associated with this project shall simultaneously become void, and the project and its 
derivative works shall lose all legal rights to use, distribute, or modify in that region, and shall
be subject to strict copyright protection.

5. INFECTIVITY CLAUSE

This License is highly infectious. Any modification, distribution, or creation of a derivative work 
based on the project code must fully attach a license that retains all existing restrictions of 
the CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v3.1. New restrictions may be added, but no existing 
restrictions may be removed.

The modified license must not be named "CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v3.1." It must be named 
as "CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE MODIFIED-v3.1" or a similar, clearly distinct name to indicate
it is a derivative work of this license. Failure to comply will result in an immediate forfeiture of 
all authorization.
