CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v3.0

Copyright (C) 2024 Conservative Software Foundation

This License is not an Open Source Software license. This License is an addendum and shall 
take legal precedence over all other licenses or agreements attached hereto. Any rights 
granted by other licenses are conditional upon strict adherence to the terms of this License.

1.AUTHORIZATION SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS

This project is not licensed for use by the following individuals or entities (hereinafter 
referred to as "Excluded Users"):

- Users Engaging in Immoral Conduct: Any individual or entity engaged in conduct explicitly
  prohibited by the Holy Bible and core Christian doctrine. This includes, but is not limited 
  to, the following:
  - Blasphemy and Apostasy: Blasphemy against God, Jesus Christ, or the Holy Spirit (Mark 3:29),
    which includes mockery, denial of their divinity, or claiming to be God. Also, deliberate 
    and persistent apostasy from the Christian faith.
  - Sexual Immorality: Committing adultery, fornication, or any other form of sexual immorality
    outside of biblical marriage, which is defined as a covenantal union between one man and one
    woman (Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20). This also includes engaging in or promoting 
    homosexual acts, same-sex marriage, or other non-biblical sexual lifestyles as morally 
    acceptable (Romans 1:26-27; Leviticus 18:22).
  - Theft and Deception: Stealing, deceit, or bearing false witness (Exodus 20:15-16). This 
    includes plagiarism, fraud, perjury, and any other act of dishonesty that harms others 
    financially, reputationally, or otherwise.
  - Violence and Hatred: Engaging in violence, hatred, or unjust persecution of others (Matthew 
    5:21-22; Galatians 5:19-21). This includes acts of physical harm, verbal abuse, cyberbullying,
    and promoting a culture of intolerance or discrimination.
  - Promotion of Vices: Promotion of content or activities that are lewd, obscene, or pornographic 
    (Ephesians 5:3-5). This includes the creation, distribution, or consumption of explicit 
    material and other content that defiles and corrupts.
  - Abortion: Engaging in abortion or supporting the practice. This license considers human life 
    sacred from conception and views abortion as the unjust taking of that life (Psalm 139:13-16;
    Jeremiah 1:5).

- Organizations Opposed to Christian Doctrine: Any organization, non-governmental or otherwise,
  that actively promotes or advocates for beliefs, practices, or legislation that are in direct 
  opposition to the moral and ethical principles of the Holy Bible, as traditionally interpreted
  by conservative Christianity. This includes organizations that support LGBTQ+ rights, abortion
  access, or other agendas deemed anti-Christian.

2.EFFECTIVENESS OF LICENSE GRANT

This License grants a limited, non-exclusive, and non-commercial license to use, copy, modify, and 
distribute the project code only to non-Excluded Users. By using this project, the user is deemed
to have fully read, understood, and agreed to all terms of this License.

3.TERMINATION AND LEGAL LIABILITY

Should the licensor determine, through reasonable judgment, that any user belongs to the category

immediately and unilaterally terminate all authorization for said user. In such a case, the user
must immediately destroy all acquired copies of the project and its derivative works and cease all

4.LEGAL CONFLICT AND INVALIDITY

If any term of this License is found to be unenforceable due to a conflict with mandatory local laws
in its jurisdiction, that term shall be deemed invalid. However, such invalidity shall not affect the
validity of the other terms of this License. In this event, all other open-source or free software 
licenses associated with this project shall simultaneously become void, and the project and its 
derivative works shall lose all legal rights to use, distribute, or modify in that region, and shall
be subject to strict copyright protection.
