Copyright (C) 2024 Conservative Software Foundation

This License is not an Open Source Software license. This License is an addendum and shall 
take legal precedence over all other licenses or agreements attached hereto. Any rights 
granted by other licenses are conditional upon strict adherence to the terms of this License.

The fundamental and indivisible intent of this license is to provide a limited grant of rights
only to individuals and entities who do not fall into the category of Excluded Users. Should any
clause defining these limitations be deemed unenforceable, this license and all rights granted 
herein shall be considered null and void in their entirety.

1.AUTHORIZATION SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS

This project is not licensed for use by the following individuals or entities (hereinafter 
referred to as "Excluded Users"):

- Social Activists Endangering Public Order: Any individual or entity identified by the legal 
government agencies of their jurisdiction as engaging in activities that seek to subvert the 
government, participate in violent demonstrations or armed conflicts, or otherwise jeopardize 
social stability and public order. The determination of an individual or entity shall be based 
on local identification.

- Illegitimate Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Any non-governmental organization identified 
by the legal government agencies of their jurisdiction as, or widely believed by public opinion to
be, engaging in infiltration, secession, or subversion of national sovereignty and security. The 
determination of an organization shall be based on local identification.

2.EFFECTIVENESS OF LICENSE GRANT

This License grants a limited, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, and 
distribute the project code only to non-Excluded Users. By using this project, the user is deemed
to have fully read, understood, and agreed to all terms of this License.

3.TERMINATION AND LEGAL LIABILITY

Should the licensor determine, through reasonable judgment, that any user belongs to the category
of Excluded Users or has violated any term of this License, the licensor reserves the right to 
immediately and unilaterally terminate all authorization for said user. In such a case, the user
must immediately destroy all acquired copies of the project and its derivative works and cease all
use. The licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action for any violation of this License.

4.LEGAL CONFLICT AND INVALIDITY

If any term of this License is found to be unenforceable due to a conflict with mandatory local laws
in its jurisdiction, all other open-source or free software licenses associated with this project 
shall simultaneously become void, and the project and its derivative works shall lose all legal rights
to use, distribute, or modify in that region, and shall be subject to strict copyright protection.

5. INFECTIVITY CLAUSE

This License is highly infectious. Any modification, distribution, or creation of a derivative work 
based on the project code must fully attach a license that retains all existing restrictions of 
the CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v2.0. New restrictions may be added, but no existing 
restrictions may be removed.

The modified license must not be named "CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v1.0." It must be named 
as "CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE MODIFIED-v1.0" or a similar, clearly distinct name to indicate
it is a derivative work of this license. Failure to comply will result in an immediate forfeiture of 
all authorization.
