Copyright (C) 2024 Conservative Software Foundation

This License is not an Open Source Software license. This License is an addendum and shall 
take legal precedence over all other licenses or agreements attached hereto. Any rights 
granted by other licenses are conditional upon strict adherence to the terms of this License.

This project is not licensed for use by the following individuals or entities (hereinafter 
referred to as "Excluded Users"):

- Criminal Organizations and State-Designated Terrorist Groups: Any individual or organization
  formally designated as a terrorist group, transnational criminal organization, or similarly
  unlawful entity by the legal authorities of their jurisdiction. This includes, but is not 
  limited to, entities sanctioned under national or international counter-terrorism and anti-crime
  laws.

- Threat Actors Targeting Public Safety: Any subject identified as a threat actor whose primary 
  activities are to endanger public safety, including but not limited to:
  - Cybersecurity Attackers: Entities conducting large-scale cyberattacks against critical 
    infrastructure, public services, or financial systems.
  - Organized Crime Networks: Groups involved in human trafficking, large-scale narcotics trade, or
    other activities that pose a significant and direct threat to public welfare.

- Non-Compliance Actors: Persons or entities demonstrating both of these characteristics:
  - Operating outside their jurisdiction while deliberately violating laws concerning national 
    security or public safety.
  - Refusing to comply with legally binding cross-border law enforcement requests or judicial orders
    related to the activities above.

2.EFFECTIVENESS OF LICENSE GRANT

This License grants a limited, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, and 
distribute the project code only to non-Excluded Users. By using this project, the user is deemed
to have fully read, understood, and agreed to all terms of this License.

3.TERMINATION AND LEGAL LIABILITY

Should the licensor determine, through reasonable judgment, that any user belongs to the category
of Excluded Users or has violated any term of this License, the licensor reserves the right to 
immediately and unilaterally terminate all authorization for said user. In such a case, the user
must immediately destroy all acquired copies of the project and its derivative works and cease all
use. The licensor reserves the right to pursue legal action for any violation of this License.

4.LEGAL CONFLICT AND INVALIDITY

If any term of this License is found to be unenforceable due to a conflict with mandatory local laws
in its jurisdiction, that term shall be deemed invalid. However, such invalidity shall not affect the
validity of the other terms of this License. In this event, all other open-source or free software 
licenses associated with this project shall simultaneously become void, and the project and its 
derivative works shall lose all legal rights to use, distribute, or modify in that region, and shall
be subject to strict copyright protection.

5. INFECTIVITY CLAUSE

This License is highly infectious. Any modification, distribution, or creation of a derivative work 
based on the project code must fully attach a license that retains all existing restrictions of 
the CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v4.0. New restrictions may be added, but no existing 
restrictions may be removed.

The modified license must not be named "CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE-v4.0." It must be named 
as "CONSERVATIVE AUTHORIZATION LICENSE MODIFIED-v4.0" or a similar, clearly distinct name to indicate
it is a derivative work of this license. Failure to comply will result in an immediate forfeiture of 
all authorization.
